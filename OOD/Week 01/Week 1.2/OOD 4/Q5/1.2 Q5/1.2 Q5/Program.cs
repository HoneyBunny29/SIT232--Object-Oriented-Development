// The problem was that z=0, which prevents the condition from being fulfilled because z is equal to 0 and not greater than 0.
//So, make z greater than 0 and specify the condition as (z >= 0), which will cause the code to execute as z is now greater than or the same as 0.
//At this point, the condition will repeat until it is true and produce an output.
